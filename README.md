# KraYz

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What the heck?

As a young kid I remember playing this very weird game on my 6128 Amstrad computer, I was maybe 5 to 7 Y/O so I have a hard time to remind the name of it.

But then we can also mention qix(xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

## What to do ?

So far everything needs to be set. A todo list will soon appear.

## Rules

The ball|object bounce on the border of the frame.

With the arrows of the keyboard lock the shape in the requested challenge.
